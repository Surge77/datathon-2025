## 🎯 Problem Statement

The rapid evolution of technology has created a significant **skill gap** between what industries demand and what professionals currently possess. This project aims to:

* Forecast **future demand** for tech skills (12–18 months ahead)
* Quantify **skill gaps** across roles, locations, and experience levels
* Analyze **salary variations** based on skill combinations
* Provide **data-driven career recommendations** and **learning paths**
* Visualize trends and insights through an **interactive dashboard**

---

## 🗂️ Data Sources

We integrated three primary Kaggle datasets:

1. **Data Science Job Market (brsahan)** – 10K+ listings; job titles, locations, salaries, and skills.
2. **Job-Skill-Set (batuhanmutlu)** – curated mapping of job roles to extracted skill sets.
3. **Global AI Job Market (bismasajjad)** – 15K+ listings across 50+ countries with salary, experience, and company data.

**Integration Strategy:** Columns were harmonized (job titles, skills, currencies, experience) and merged into a unified dataset `cleaned_master.csv`.

## ⚙️ Methodology Overview

### **Phase 1 – Data Collection & Cleaning (Completed)**

* Gathered raw datasets from Kaggle sources.
* Standardized schema, handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
* Validated integrity using automated quality checks.
* Generated `data_quality_report.json` summarizing completeness and validity.

### **Phase 2 – Pre-processing & Feature Engineering (Completed)**

* Standardized skills through normalization and taxonomy mapping.
* Engineered features: `salary_midpoint`, `skill_count`, `posting_year`, etc.
* Generated profiling snapshots (`profiling_categorical_snapshot.csv`, `profiling_numeric_snapshot.csv`).
* Exported unified cleaned dataset for downstream modeling.

### **Phase 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (Completed)**

* Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis on `cleaned_master.csv`.
* Identified correlations, hiring trends, salary distributions, and geographic demand.
* Generated 30+ visualizations stored in `/outputs/figures/`.
* Derived insights:

  * Salary increases significantly with seniority and full-time roles.
  * Remote jobs offer competitive compensation.
  * Most in-demand skills: **Python, SQL, Machine Learning, Cloud, Tableau.**
  * Leading hiring regions: **USA, India, UK, Germany.**

### **Phase 4 – Modeling & Evaluation (Completed)**

* **Forecasting:** Skill demand predictions (12–18 months) using **Naive, ARIMA, Prophet** models.
* **Salary Prediction:** Ridge, Random Forest, and XGBoost regressors achieving **R² > 0.7**.
* **Outputs:**

  * `models/salary_predictor.pkl`, `models/skill_demand_forecast.pkl`
  * `outputs/tables/model_metrics.csv`, `outputs/figures/model_performance.png`
* Insights:

  * AI/ML and Cloud-related skills expected to grow 15–20%.
  * Skills like **TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Kubernetes** offer the highest salary premiums.

### **Phase 5 – Visualization & Reporting (Completed)**

* Created an **interactive Power BI dashboard** integrating forecast and salary insights.
* Dashboard visuals stored in `/dashboards/dashboard_screenshots/`.
* Final report and presentation prepared for Datathon submission.
* Visualizations highlight:

  * Skill demand trends and salary growth patterns.
  * Career path recommendations based on forecast data.
  * Skill gap heatmaps and geographic insights.
