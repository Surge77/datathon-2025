## 🎯 Problem Statement

The tech job market faces a widening **skill gap** — companies struggle to hire the right talent while professionals are unsure which skills to pursue. My goal is to:

* Identify **high-demand skills** in the next 12–18 months
* Quantify the **gap** between current workforce skills and industry needs
* Map **skill combinations** to salary trends
* Recommend **optimal learning paths** for career growth
* Highlight **geographic variations** in demand

## 📂 Datasets

Using Kaggle datasets:

1. **Data Science Job Market Dataset** – 10k+ job listings with skills, salaries, locations
2. **Job-Skill-Set Dataset** – Pre-processed skill extractions for job listings
3. **Global AI Job Market & Salary Trends 2025** – 15k+ listings across 50+ countries

**Data Integration Strategy:** Standardize skill names, unify schema, merge on skills/job titles/salaries.
